Object Oriented Programming (OOP):

Object-oriented programming is a form of programming that allows programmers to think as if they are working with real-life entities (a thing with a distinct and independent existence) or objects.

*Basic terminologies:*

Object: it is a dedicated and continuous block of memory allocated to store information like variables, methods or functions etc.

Class: It is a template or blue print about the capability of what an object can do.

Method: The behaviours of a class. It tells what a method can do.

Instance: The instance is a block of memory, which contains the reference to an object. In other words, the instance will hold the address of the starting memory block where the object is stored.

*Object-oriented programming concepts:*

Encapsulation: is a mechanism of wrapping the data (instance variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit like a Class.

The main purpose of encapsulation is you would have full control on data by using the code.

Encapsulation can be described as a protective barrier that prevents the code and data being randomly accessed by other code defined outside the class. Access to the data and code is tightly controlled by a class.

Abstraction: Abstraction allows you to highlight the most representative part of something, ignoring details to focus on the main thing.

Polymorphism: is the characteristic of being able to assign a different meaning or usage to something in different contexts ‚Äî specifically, to allow an entity such as a function, or an object to have more than one form.

Inheritance: Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another.
