## Week challenges (Monday) üíª

1. Follow the github course, you can find it [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123)
2. Create an account in Codewars, follow [this instructions](./_create_account_codewars/)
3. Read about: if...else

 `if:` The if statement is used in situations where a certain bit of code only needs to be executed if certain conditions are met. Its syntax is as follows
```javascript
if(condition){
code;
}
```
`if...else:`The else statement is used to specify a block of code that will be executed if the condition of the if statement is false.
Syntax:
```javascript
if(condition){
code to execute if condition is true;
}
else {
code to execute if condition is false;
}
```
`if...else if:`The if...else if is used to check a different condition if the first condition fails. Syntax:
```javascript
if(condition 1){
code block 1;
}
else if(condition 2){
code block 2
}
else {
code block 3;
}
```
4. Read about: for

`for:`
The for loop is used to repeat one or more statements a specified number of times. Of all the loops, the For is used when we know for sure the number of times we want it to be executed. Syntax:
```javascript
for(statement 1; statement 2; statement 3){
block of code to execute;
}
```
`statement 1:`
This statement is executed before loop start (just once)

`statement 2:`
This statement is the conditional check that is executed before each iteration.

`statement 3:`
This statement is executed at the end of each iteration of the loop.

5. Read about: while

`while:`The While Loop Looks for a condition at the beginning of the code block and only executes the code if the condition is true. Syntax:
```javascript
while(condition){
code block;
}
```
6. Read about: functions

`funtion:` A function is a piece of code designed to perform a particular task or to be reused over and over again. Functions help reduce code length and improve code recoverability.

The 'function' declaration is used to define a function, followed by a name for the function, which is then followed by a set of parentheses. syntax:
```javascript
function name(){
code block;
}
```
