## Week challenges (Tuesday) üíª

- [x] 1. Check the [All You Need To Know About TypeScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCZhz0JCVx0) video
- [x] 2. Read this [Answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12694530/what-is-typescript-and-why-would-i-use-it-in-place-of-javascript/35048303#35048303), for the following question: `"What is TypeScript and why would I use it in place of JavaScript?"`


`¬øWhat is Typescript?`

`TypeScript` is a "superset of JavaScript, adding static typing and class-based objects."

Developed and maintained by Microsoft, Typescript, being open-source, extends the syntax of JavaScript. That means any existing JavaScript code would work just fine.

`¬øWhy use typescript instead of JavaScript?`

According to a study, TypeScript can prevent up to 15% of failures in our projects. TypeScript is going to be constantly analyzing our code indicating possible flaws or better ways to write our code.

In JavaScript, you only realize that you have an error until the moment you execute it, either in the browser or in a runtime environment like NodeJS, but not before. What we want as developers is to get feedback as soon as possible to have the fewest bugs in production.

In TypeScript with static code analysis we notice errors in the editor or when transpiling, so we prevent errors from reaching execution.


- [x] 3. Check the [5 reasons to use TypeScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDCjP9VLoPo) video

1. `Type safety`

  TypeScript provides data type safety to JavaScript. This feature allows developers to be very efficient and introduce fewer bugs because programs written in TypeScript are compiled.

2. `Classes, Interfaces and Inheritance.`

  TypeScript has all the tools of an object-oriented programming language like classes, interfaces, inheritance, modules, etc. In the TypeScript language you can write code for both client-side and server-side development.

3. `IDE experience`

  Great IDE experience tools like VisualStudio and Adam code have great typing support and using strong typing allows them to provide features like predictive assistance and intellisense.

4. `Future proof`

  Typescript brings the future of JavaScript to today's development you can use the new features of ES6, ES7 and beyond it must script and the compiler will convert them to ES5 or whatever you choose so now we can make use of the newer features of JavaScript without having to worry about compatibility.

5. `Grow as you go`
  
  You already get JavaScript code no problem since Typescript is a superset of JavaScript all your existing JavaScript code is typescript code you could quickly start by changing all your JS files to dot files and then adding a TS config  .JSON then you start learning and using features one by one.


- [x] 4. Review OOP concepts again with the [Fundamental Concepts of Object Oriented Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_MQYyJpIjg) video

- [x] 5. Check this [Object Oriented Programming - The Four Pillars of OOP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ONhXmQuWP8) video, this video use Java, but the idea is the same
