A popular interview question concerns the four basic concepts of object-oriented programming. These concepts are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. Before programming oriented to use a programming procedure that divided objects in a program into a set of functions, so that having data stored in a bunch of variables and functions that operate on the data, this style of programming is very simple and straightforward. It's often what we learn as part of our programming course at a university but as our programs grow we end up with a bunch of functions that are all over the place, we may find ourselves copying and pasting lines of code over and over again , we make a change in a function and then we vary other functions and they break, that is what is known as spaghetti code, there is a lot of interdependence between all these functions and it becomes problematic and object-oriented programming came to solve this problem.

Object-oriented programming combines a group of variables and related functions into one unit. We call that unit an object. We refer to these variables as properties and functions as methods.
In object-oriented programming we group related variables and functions that operate on them into objects and this is what we call encapsulation.

Abstraction allows us to use a technique for our objects so that we can hide some of the properties and methods from the outside and this gives us a couple of benefits first is that we will make the interface of those objects simpler, by compressing an object with some properties and methods is easier than an object with several properties and methods, the second benefit is that it helps us reduce the impact of the change, let's imagine that tomorrow we change these internal or private methods these changes will leak to the outside because we don't have any code that touch these methods outside of their container object. We can remove a method or change its parameters but neither of these changes will affect the rest of the application code so with abstraction we reduce the impact of changing.

The third central concept in object-oriented programming is inheritance, which is a mechanism that allows you to eliminate redundant code.

Finally polymorphism, poly means many, morphism means shape, and polymorphism means many shapes in object orientation. Programming polymorphism is a technique that allows you to get rid of long ethanol or switch and case statements.

These are the benefits of object oriented programming, programming using encapsulation we group related variables and functions together and in this way we can reduce complexity now we can reuse this and make object from parts of a program or in different programs with abstraction we hide the details and complexity and show only the essentials, this technique reduces complexity and also isolates the impact of code changes with inheritance we can eliminate redundant code and with polymorphism we can refactor ugly switch/case statements.
