## Week challenges (Tuesday) üíª

1. Base on [this reading](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/compiled-versus-interpreted-languages/) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1f45REi3k4), create an explanation about `Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages` in your README

Compiled languages: they are those that require a compiler so that a written program can be executed, the compiler is a program that takes the source code and translates it in such a way that it results in an executable file which is now written in machine language that is, in ones and zeros or better known as binary code.

Interpreted languages: They are a little simpler, in these languages an interpreter is needed so that the written source code can be executed, what the interpreter does is take the file and go line by line translating that language to the machine code, but at runtime.

2. Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both?, check the sources and answer the question in your README

The answer is both. In Java, the compiler is in charge of translating the source code of a program into an intermediate code called bytecode that is independent of the platform on which it works and that is executed by the Java interpreter that is part of the Java Virtual Machine ( JVM).

Modern JVMs use a technique called Just In Time (JIT) compilation to compile bytecode into native instructions understood by the hardware CPU on the fly at run time.
