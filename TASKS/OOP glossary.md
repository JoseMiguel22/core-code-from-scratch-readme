`key-words`

1. `Abstraction`

   It is the process by which all information that is not relevant in a particular context is discarded, emphasizing some of the details or properties of the objects. Abstraction consists of capturing the characteristics and functionalities that an object performs and these are represented in classes by means of attributes and methods of said class.

2. `Inheritance`

    It is the mechanism by which a class allows inheriting the characteristics (attributes and methods) of another class.

    Inheritance allows you to define new classes based on existing ones in order to reuse code, thus generating a hierarchy of classes within an application. If a class derives from another, it inherits its attributes and methods and can add new attributes, methods or redefine the inherited ones.

3. `Polymorphism`

   It is the ability of certain languages to make it so that when sending the same message (or, in other words, calling the same method) from different objects, each of those objects can respond to that message (or call) differently.

4. `Encapsulation`

    It is when we limit the access or give a restricted access of a property to the elements that a member needs and not to any other.

    The most common element of encapsulation are classes, where we encapsulate and wrap both methods and properties.

5. `Class`

   Description/template of an object. It consists of a series of methods and data that summarize the characteristics of an object. Defining classes allows you to work with reusable code. Since from a class you can create an instance and thus reuse the code written for it without having to rewrite the code for the instance. The instance takes the pattern of the parent class. However, the variables are independent.

6. `Object`

   It represents some real-life entity, that is, some of the unique objects that belong to the problem we are dealing with, and with which we can interact.

   Each object, just like the real-life entity it represents, has a state (that is, attributes with specific values) and behavior (that is, it has functionalities or knows how to perform specific actions).

   Informally, we can say that an object is any single element in the real world that can be interacted with.

7. `Instance`

   Any object that derives from another is called an instance. In this way, all objects are instances of some other, except for the Object class, which is the mother of all.

8. `Interface`

   An interface is a contract between two entities, this means that an interface provides a service to a consumer class. Therefore, the interface only shows us the declaration of the methods it has, not its implementation, thus allowing its encapsulation.

9. `Access Modifiers`
   Access modifiers allow the designer of a class to determine who accesses the data and member methods of a class. The access modifiers precede the declaration of a member element of the class (whether it is an attribute or a method) and there are four of them:

   - default or package-private (when nothing is written)

   - public

   - protected

   - private
10. `Constructors`

   It is a set of instructions specially designed to initialize an instance of an object.
