`key-words`

1. `Abstraction`

   It is the process by which all information that is not relevant in a particular context is discarded, emphasizing some of the details or properties of the objects. Abstraction consists of capturing the characteristics and functionalities that an object performs and these are represented in classes by means of attributes and methods of said class.

2. `Inheritance`

    It is the mechanism by which a class allows inheriting the characteristics (attributes and methods) of another class.

    Inheritance allows you to define new classes based on existing ones in order to reuse code, thus generating a hierarchy of classes within an application. If a class derives from another, it inherits its attributes and methods and can add new attributes, methods or redefine the inherited ones.

3. `Polymorphism`

   It is the ability of certain languages to make it so that when sending the same message (or, in other words, calling the same method) from different objects, each of those objects can respond to that message (or call) differently.

4. `Encapsulation`

    It is when we limit the access or give a restricted access of a property to the elements that a member needs and not to any other.

    The most common element of encapsulation are classes, where we encapsulate and wrap both methods and properties.

5. `Class`
   It defines a group or set of data, in objects they are called attributes, which define the objects, as well as a set of behaviors, the functions or methods of the object, which manipulate it and relate the objects to each other.

   The attributes and methods are the members of the class.
